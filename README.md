This will start the Node.js server and make the app available at http://localhost:3000.

Step 5: Explore the Codebase

Open the project in your code editor or IDE and explore the codebase. The project is organized into the following directories:

src: Contains the application code, including the backend API, frontend client, and database models.
tests: Contains unit tests and integration tests for the application.
docs: Contains documentation for the project, including API documentation and user guides.

Step 6: Start Contributing
